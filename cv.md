## Summary

I've been into front-end development since 2005. But in 2007 or 2008, I had to drop this case. All efforts were directed towards completing my studies at the university. In 2013 he completed his studies at the Faculty of Applied Informatics in Economics. In 2014 he got a job as a system administrator and from this year he developed as DevOps. But thoughts about front-end development did not leave and I constantly came across it at work and since 2016 I plunged into training from scratch, since a lot of things have changed in development since I left it. Now I also continue to work as a system administrator, but I devote most of my free time to front-end development and develop in this direction to this day and also began to attract UI / UX design. I really like front-end development as a hobby for now, but I want to turn this hobby into a favorite job and benefit society.))
